# docsbackup
Enables weekly per-user Documents folder backups to google drive folder mounted via ocamlfuse method. Compresses backup using zip, and maintains a single copy of the previous backup to the current one.

Note: You need a Google account, and to have mounted your google drive folder using the ocamlfuse method. More information on how to do that can be found here: https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-mount-your-google-drive-on-linux-with-google-drive-ocamlfuse/

A good place to store my scripts is in the bin subfolder of your home folder ($HOME/bin) just make sure it's in your PATH

As with all my scripts I recommend you read and understand what this script does, and make any changes necessary to suit your setup before launching it for the first time.
